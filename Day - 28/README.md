# Day 28 – Building Apps with AI Assistants using AGENTS.md

This project is part of the **#30DaysOfAI** challenge by Streamlit.

## Goal

Use an **AI coding assistant** with `AGENTS.md` to automatically generate a complete **Streamlit data analysis app** instead of writing everything manually.

## What this app does

- Upload a CSV dataset
- Preview and explore the data
- Show basic statistics
- Generate charts automatically
- Perform quick analysis without writing code

## Built Using AI Assistant

Instead of coding from scratch, I used:

@AGENTS.md create a data analysis tool with CSV upload

inside **VS Code (GitHub Copilot/AI assistant)**.

The assistant generated:

- app.py
- requirements.txt
- README.md

with production-ready structure and best practices.

## Dataset Used

Google Play App Reviews Dataset

Includes:

- Review text
- Ratings
- Thumbs up count
- Review dates
- Developer responses
- App versions

Useful for:

- Sentiment analysis
- Feedback mining
- User satisfaction trends
- App quality insights

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Matplotlib/Charts
- AGENTS.md
- AI Assistant (Copilot/ChatGPT/Claude)

## Key Concept: AGENTS.md

AGENTS.md acts like a **README for AI agents**.

It defines:

- App architecture
- Coding conventions
- Streamlit patterns
- Best practices
- Deployment rules

So the AI can generate:

- clean code
- consistent structure
- ready-to-run apps

without repeated instructions.

## How it Works

### 1. Add AGENTS.md

Place AGENTS.md inside the project folder.

### 2. Ask AI

Give a single instruction:

@AGENTS.md create a data analysis tool with CSV upload

### 3. AI Generates the App

The assistant automatically:

- creates Streamlit UI
- adds file uploader
- loads CSV with pandas
- shows tables and charts
- prepares requirements

### 4. Run Locally

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Start app:
streamlit run app.py

## Key Learning

AI assistants can now build **entire apps from structured instructions**, not just code snippets.

This shifts development from:
manual coding

to:
prompt-driven app generation

Result:

- faster builds
- fewer bugs
- consistent architecture
- higher productivity
